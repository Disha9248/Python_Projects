## Project Overview
This project analyzes weather data to identify trends in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and extreme weather events. The goal is to understand seasonal variations, detect climate change patterns, and potentially predict future weather conditions.


## Objectives
- Analyze temperature and precipitation trends over time.
- Detect patterns in extreme weather events (heatwaves, storms, floods).
- Compare seasonal variations across different regions.
- Learn how to use Python for data analysis tasks such as aggregation, filtering, and ranking.
- Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.
- Develop skills for performance analysis using Pandas by solving different types of data problems related to user performance.


## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of Pandas and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems.I have worked with a small dataset and had used Pandas library to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.


## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
 - **Dataset Link**: [Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/weather-data)<br><br>


## Dataset Columns
Dataset contains total 8 columns namely :
- Date/time
- Temp_C
- Dewpoint_Temp_C
- Rel_hum_%
- Windspeed Km/h
- Visibility_km
- Press_kpa
- Weather<br><br>
  

## SQL Problems and Questions
Here are the SQL problems that I have solved as part of this project:

#### Q1)  Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.
#### Q2) Find the number of times when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.
#### Q3) Find the number of times when the 'Wind Speed was exactly 4 km/h'.
#### Q4) Find out all the Null Values in the data.
#### Q5) Rename the column name 'Weather' of the dataframe to 'Weather Condition'.
#### Q6) What is the mean 'Visibility' ?
#### Q7) What is the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure'  in this data?
#### Q8) What is the Variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data ?
#### Q9) Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
#### Q10) Find all instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.
#### Q11) What is the Mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition ?
#### Q12) What is the Minimum & Maximum value of each column against each 'Weather Condition ?
#### Q13) Show all the Records where Weather Condition is Fog.
#### Q14) Find all instances when 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.
#### Q15) Find all instances when :
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. 'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. 'Visibility is above 40'<br><br>



## The Commands That Are Used In This Project 

- `import pandas as pd` - To import Pandas library<br>
- `pd.read_csv` - To import the CSV file in Jupyter notebook<br>
- `head()` - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5)<br>
- `shape` - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe<br>
- `df.info()` - To show the datatype of each column.
- `unique()` - It shows the all unique values of the column.
- `value_counts` - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied to a single column only.
- `dtypes` - To show datatypes of each column.<br>


## Conclusion
This project provides an excellent opportunity for me as a beginners to gain Pandas knowledge to solve practical data problems. By working through these Python queries, I gain hands-on experience with data cleaning, filtering, date manipulation, and conditional logic.
